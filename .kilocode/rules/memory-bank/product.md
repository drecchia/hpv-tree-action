# Tree Action - Product

## Why This Project Exists
Tree Action solves the complex problem of building interactive hierarchical interfaces with granular permissions. Traditional treeview libraries either lack permission systems, require heavy frameworks, or don't handle large datasets efficiently.

## Problems It Solves
- **Complex Permission Management**: Hierarchical interfaces often need different permissions at different levels (folder vs file permissions)
- **Performance with Large Datasets**: Loading thousands of nodes simultaneously causes performance issues
- **Framework Lock-in**: Many treeview solutions require specific frameworks, limiting flexibility
- **Limited Customization**: Most treeview libraries offer limited styling and behavior customization

## How It Should Work
Tree Action provides a simple yet powerful API for creating interactive treeviews:

1. **Simple Initialization**: Create a tree with minimal configuration
2. **Node Management**: Add, remove, update nodes with automatic UI updates
3. **Permission System**: Set granular permissions (Create, Read, Update, Delete) per node
4. **Lazy Loading**: Load child nodes on-demand to handle large datasets
5. **Search & Filter**: Find nodes quickly with highlighting and path expansion
6. **Event-Driven**: Respond to user interactions through a comprehensive event system

## User Experience Goals
- **Intuitive**: Users should immediately understand how to interact with the tree
- **Fast**: Operations should feel instant, even with large datasets
- **Accessible**: Works with keyboard navigation and screen readers
- **Customizable**: Easy to style and adapt to different design systems
- **Reliable**: Handles edge cases gracefully with proper error handling

## Key Differentiators
- **Zero Dependencies**: Works without any external libraries
- **Permission Inheritance**: Child nodes can inherit or override parent permissions
- **Mixed State Support**: Parent nodes show mixed state when children have different permission states
- **Advanced Search**: Searches through lazy-loaded content with smart highlighting
- **Event System**: Comprehensive events for all tree operations and state changes
