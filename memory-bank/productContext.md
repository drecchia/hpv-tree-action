# Product Context: Tree CRUDS Selection Component

## Problem Space
Organizations need to manage complex permission hierarchies for file systems, content management systems, and other tree-structured data. Traditional permission management interfaces often lack:
- Visual clarity in permission inheritance
- Efficient bulk permission management
- Flexibility in operation types
- Intuitive user interfaces for complex hierarchies

## Solution
The Tree CRUDS Selection Component provides a visual, interactive interface for managing hierarchical permissions with these key features:

### 1. Visual Permission Management
- Tree structure clearly shows relationships
- Color-coded states for quick understanding
  - Green: Allowed
  - Red: Denied
  - White: Unselected
  - Mixed state for partial selections
- Immediate visual feedback for changes

### 2. Efficient Operations
- Bulk updates through parent nodes
- Automatic permission inheritance
- Quick expansion/collapse of sections
- Lazy loading for performance
- Level-based expansion controls

### 3. Flexible Configuration
- Customizable operation types
- Dynamic addition/removal of operations
- Configurable tooltips
- Adaptable to various use cases

## Target Users
1. System Administrators
   - Managing file system permissions
   - Configuring access controls

2. Content Managers
   - Setting document permissions
   - Managing shared resources

3. Project Managers
   - Controlling project asset access
   - Managing team permissions

## Use Cases

### 1. File System Management
- Setting folder/file permissions
- Managing access hierarchies
- Configuring sharing rights

### 2. Content Management Systems
- Document access control
- Media library permissions
- User-generated content management

### 3. Project Resource Management
- Team access controls
- Asset permission management
- Collaborative workspace configuration
