# Product Context: Tree Action

## Problem Space

### Core Problems Addressed
1. Complex Hierarchical Data Display
   - Organizations need to visualize and manage nested data structures
   - Traditional list views don't effectively convey parent-child relationships
   - Users need intuitive navigation through deep hierarchies

2. Permission Management
   - Different users need different levels of access to tree nodes
   - Access rights often follow hierarchical patterns
   - Mixed states must be clearly indicated for partial permissions

3. Data Loading Optimization
   - Large trees can cause performance issues if loaded all at once
   - Users need immediate access to visible nodes
   - Background loading should be seamless and non-blocking

4. Interactive Tree Operations
   - Users need to perform CRUD operations within the tree structure
   - Operations must respect hierarchical relationships
   - Changes must be reflected immediately in the UI
